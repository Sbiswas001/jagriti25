          <h1><u>About GCECT and Jagriti</u></h1>
          <p>
            Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology (GCECT),
            formerly known as College of Ceramic Technology (CCT), is a premier
            government-funded autonomous engineering institute in Kolkata,
            India. GCECT has already carved a niche for itself in academic
            circuits and is gradually becoming a well-known name amongst
            engineering aspirants with its great placement and internship
            records abroad, as well as countless successful alumni of the
            college, spread globally.
          </p>

          <p>
            While academic excellence is intended to be unwavering at GCECT, we
            believe that the importance of literary, cultural and athletic
            ability is indelible to the integrated experience of an engineering
            institution. Aiming to enrich development, it will be held in the
            month of March. Following the huge success of previous JAGRITI
            editions, this year is sure to be worth taking your two doses of fun
            for, only to be enhanced by your enthusiastic participation
          </p>

          <p>
            Starting with Rupankar’s show, Anjan Dutta, Somlata, Zephyrtone, and
            a slew of other notable artists. To name a few, Jagriti has seen
            performances by Fossils, Cactus, Underground Authority,
            Lakkhichhara, Bolpur Blues, etc. JAGRITI’s events and competitions
            have received a positive response over the years. We, on the other
            hand, have made a different plan by incorporating tech talks and
            e-discussion talks in entrepreneurship. As a youth festival, JAGRITI
            has previously targeted the youth with social initiatives such as a
            blood donation camp, an eye-testing campaign and a homeopathic
            clinic. Jagriti makes it a priority to affect positive social
            change.
          </p>

          <h1><u>VISION:</u></h1>
          <p>
            JAGRITI, our flagship cultural event, formerly known as Cera-fest,
            is permanently implemented as a way to foster the bonding amongst
            people from different regions of the country.
          </p>

          <h1><u>AIM:</u></h1>
          <p>
            Jagriti's main aim is to forget the monotonous routine of everyday
            life for a few moments, to dive deep into having a chance to relax
            and becoming alive. Let us celebrate this event with full vim and
            vigor.
