            <p>
              Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology (GCECT),
              formerly known as College of Ceramic Technology (CCT), is a
              premier government-funded autonomous engineering institute in
              Kolkata, India. GCECT has already carved a niche for itself in
              academic circuits and is gradually becoming a well-known name
              amongst engineering aspirants with its great placement and
              internship records abroad, as well as countless successful alumni
              of the college, spread globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              While academic excellence is intended to be unwavering at GCECT,
              we believe that the importance of literary, cultural and athletic
              ability is indelible to the integrated experience of an
              engineering institution. Aiming to enrich development, it will be
              held in the month of March. Following the huge success of previous
              JAGRITI editions, this year is sure to be worth taking your two
              doses of fun for, only to be enhanced by your enthusiastic
              participation.

              Starting with Rupankar's show, Anjan Dutta, Somlata, Zephyrtone,
              and a slew of other notable artists. To name a few, Jagriti has
              seen performances by Fossils, Cactus, Underground Authority,
              Lakkhichhara, Bolpur Blues, etc. JAGRITI's events and competitions
              have received a positive response over the years. We, on the other
              hand, have made a different plan by incorporating tech talks and
              e-discussion talks in entrepreneurship. As a youth festival,
              JAGRITI has previously targeted the youth with social initiatives
              such as a blood donation camp, an eye-testing campaign and a
              homeopathic clinic. Jagriti makes it a priority to affect positive
              social change.

              Jagriti's main aim is to forget the monotonous routine of everyday
              life for a few moments, to dive deep into having a chance to relax
              and becoming alive. Let us celebrate this event with full vim and
              vigor.
