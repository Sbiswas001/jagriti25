          <p>
            <strong>Musicon</strong>: Battle of Bands is an exciting
            inter-college event that invites talented collegiate bands to
            compete and showcase their musical prowess. This is your chance to
            take the stage, perform live, and make your mark in the world of
            music! Each band will get 14 minutes, including 10 minutes for the
            performance and 4 minutes for the sound check. Exceeding this time
            limit will lead to penalties, so ensure you plan your set carefully.
            The organizers will provide essential equipment such as drums,
            microphones, plug-ins, and sound arrangements, but bands must bring
            their own instruments. Judges will evaluate based on creativity,
            technical skills, and stage presence, so bring your best performance
            forward. Rules and regulations may be subject to changes as decided
            by the organizers, so stay informed.
